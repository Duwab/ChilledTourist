# Installer

Could be a simple web page (html + jquery), which would always be available
to check other services status (APIs, databases, react) and would give the
links to reach these applications.

It could the eventually be extended to be a manager that could fetch/merge/update databases or something like that, but it would be much easier to manage it inside the backoffice. To see in the future.
